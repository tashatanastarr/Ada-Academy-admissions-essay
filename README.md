I have several reasons for wanting to join Ada. I thrive in a classroom setting.  
I’ve taken over 200 college level classes mostly just for the joy of learning. I  
find studying on my own has its limitations; such as lack of insight from fellow   
students, guidance from teachers, and limited focus time. Validation is another   
reason I would love to be admitted. Let us say I finish all the free tutorials I  
can get my hands on. Then what? I go more indebted for a masters that may or may  
not get me a job? The taxi driver that took me to the airport from college had a  
Master’s degree in Anthropology. Maybe, but I have bills to pay and I’m more than   
ready for a career. Ada has a commendable reputation for programmers. Programmers   
that help in the diversity in the field. Computer programming impacts most people’s  
lives. Increases in diversity in the field of programming can only broaden the   
spectrum that technology can have positive befits on society. This is an incredibly  
exciting time in our technological evolution and I want the skills to help. I have  
had several great ideas for cellphone applications that came to floriation through   
someone else with the skill set to develop it.

Well, since I love Anthropology, I would like to interweave what I learned in both   
fields to help save our collective heritage and/or through user interface.  
Archaeological sites are, for the most part, hard to connect to the actual people who  
once lived and breathed where now a bunch of rocks or ruins lay. I’ve seen some 3D  
modeling and artistic renditions. These are helpful but they are few and require many  
months to finish. I am also interested how virtual and augmented reality could be used.  
This technology is up and coming still. Imagine standing in Pompeii (or Walnut Canyon   
seasonal farming hut outside Flagstaff, AZ) and holding your phone over a still crumbing  
wall. When you move your phone’s AR application over the wall what now appears before you  
is a finished wall and colorful fresco. Virtual people walking by? Maybe that too.

My mother was a teen when she had me. So, like most teen mothers, we were either extremely  
poor or lived with my grandparents. For a couple years we didn’t have pluming, electricity  
or much food. My single mother finished putting herself through college to be a teacher.   
She was obsessed with Japan when she was in college and we were surrounded by Japanese culture.  
She is now an ESL teach and fluent in Spanish and married to a Brazilian man. My brother married  
a seconded generation immigrant from El Salvador. I am married to a Chinese man.

I have disabilities that I have persevered through. I mentioned in another essay more about my   
migraines and anxiety disorder. I also have dyslexia. Through my mother’s help and tricks, I taught  
myself along the way, I made it through high school reasonably well.  However, in college I started  
having problem with professor ignorance and discrimination. When I transferred to Flagstaff my mother  
came and helped me enroll in both the US disability office and my college’s disability center.

I have compassion and empathy. I volunteer a lot. I’ve helped with so many organizations and individual  
people that the list alone would take up a page. I believe that helping other is essential to   
“being a good person”. I will continue to do this when I finally get a good paying job. I know what its  
like to be down on your luck and have the cards stacked against you.

Mistakes are one of those relative, philosophical questions in life. Mistakes are all learning scenarios  
that shape who we are. Should I have saved that term paper into Dropbox before my computer crashed; probably?  
But rewriting it made me learn the topic more, improved my writing and perhaps gave me a different take on it.  
So, I’ll say continuing to take college classes with no realistic outcome because I was on disability for migraines   
and anxiety and had nothing better to do with my life anyway, is my most significant mistake. However, now I have a   
broad range of knowledge. Although, now I have a huge student debt and no prospects of a career which would see that  
cleared before I die. I had celiac disease that attacked my brain and some spine injury that gave me migraines so bad  
that I would spend several days agonizing and throwing up. Fortunately, it was not brain cancer or some unknown ailment.  
I could have graduated earlier, gotten better grades and tried to make it in the real word but the chances of success   
would have been minimal. If I could do it all again I would probably have just stayed at The Evergreen State College   
and finished that degree instead of moving a couple of times and finally enrolling at NAU. However, I had a traumatic  
event happen to me there, so perhaps I should have taken my two-year full ride scholarship to a different school.   
But then I wouldn’t be me and I generally like myself.
